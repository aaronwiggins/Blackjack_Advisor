# Blackjack Advisor


## Problem
Create a game where you advise the player which is the best move based on their
current hand.

## Criteria for Assignment
Although Blackjack is a game of chance, it is simple enough that the
mathematically optimal next move can be given for any hand. Give the player a
set of optimal moves for a 1 deck blackjack hand. Ask the user for his or her
current hand and the dealer's up card, then give the user his or her optimal
move.

### The Program Should...
-Contain one hash within a hash

-Use the set of optimum rules found [here](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/calculator/)

-Allow for J, Q, and K for Jack, Queen, and King. The user *should* have to enter A for Ace.
